# Push Notifications Fix for Expo SDK 53

## Problem
You're getting this error:
```
expo-notification Android push notification functionality provided by expo notification was removed from expo go with release of sdk 53 use a development build instead
```

This happens because **Expo Go removed push notification support in SDK 53**.

## Solution: Use Development Build

### Option 1: Quick Fix (Recommended)

1. **Install EAS CLI** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   npm install -g @expo/eas-cli
   ```

2. **Login to your Expo account**:
   ```bash
   eas login
   ```

3. **Build a development version for Android**:
   ```bash
   npx eas build --profile development --platform android
   ```

4. **Install the development build** on your device:
   - Download the APK from the EAS build link
   - Install it on your Android device
   - Use this development build instead of Expo Go

### Option 2: Local Development Build

If you want to build locally:

1. **Install EAS CLI**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @expo/eas-cli
   ```

2. **Configure local builds**:
   ```bash
   eas build:configure
   ```

3. **Build locally**:
   ```bash
   eas build --profile development --platform android --local
   ```

### Option 3: Downgrade to SDK 52 (Not Recommended)

If you must use Expo Go for development:

1. **Downgrade Expo SDK**:
   ```bash
   npx expo install expo@~52.0.0
   ```

2. **Update all Expo packages**:
   ```bash
   npx expo install --fix
   ```

## What's Already Fixed

✅ **Backend**: The `PushNotificationService` now has the missing `sendNewMessageNotification()` method

✅ **App Configuration**: Added `expo-dev-client` plugin and EAS configuration

✅ **Error Handling**: Added better error messages that guide you to the solution

## Testing Push Notifications

Once you have a development build:

1. **Install the development build** on your device
2. **Open the app** and log in
3. **Check the console** for push token generation
4. **Send a message** to test notifications

## Development Workflow

### For Development:
- Use the **development build** for testing push notifications
- Use **Expo Go** for other development (UI, API calls, etc.)

### For Production:
- Push notifications will work normally in production builds

## Troubleshooting

### If you still get errors:

1. **Check if you're using the development build**:
   - The app should show "Development Build" in the title
   - Not "Expo Go"

2. **Verify EAS project ID**:
   - Check `app.json` has the correct `projectId`
   - Make sure you're logged into the right Expo account

3. **Check device permissions**:
   - Ensure notifications are enabled in device settings
   - Grant notification permissions when prompted

### Common Issues:

- **"Project ID not found"**: Check your `app.json` configuration
- **"Permission denied"**: Grant notification permissions in device settings
- **"Token not generated"**: Make sure you're using a physical device, not an emulator

## Next Steps

1. **Build the development version** using the commands above
2. **Install it on your device**
3. **Test push notifications** by sending messages
4. **Continue development** with the development build

The push notification functionality will work perfectly once you're using a development build instead of Expo Go!
